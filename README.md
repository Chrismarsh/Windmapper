Wind_mapper is a tool used to produce pre-computed libraries of wind field used for wind downscaling. Wind_mapper uses the [WindNinja](https://github.com/firelab/windninja) wind diagnostic model. It has been primarily developped for wind downscaling for the Canadian Hydrological Model [CHM](https://github.com/Chrismarsh/CHM).
